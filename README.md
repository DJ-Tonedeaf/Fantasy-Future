my code-less ideas on a videogame that helps make the world a better place

The goal here is to craft another layer of the internet where it's easier to connect with people, nature, technology, education, art, and science in healthy ways. The main idea is make a game out of making the world a better place. Players can earn points by playing games or taking lessons or creating content or reviewing media or training AIs or earn lots of points by teaching classes. Points can be used to buy food, material goods, and Bitcoin. We want videogame preservation in which copyright holders and original developers get points every time their game is played.

It'll also include a time machine, cataloging 17 years of stockpiled art.
