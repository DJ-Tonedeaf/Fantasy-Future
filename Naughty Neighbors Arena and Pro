Naughty Neighbors is the core of Fantasy Future. Where people come to live and die.

Naughty Neighbors has 3 modes:

Naughty Neighbors
Naughty Neighbors Arena
Naughty Neighbors Pro

I'll start with Arena.

    - **Naughty Neighbors Arena**

In NNA, all combatants start out spread out in a random neighborhood. Some of the houses will have players inside, some will have bots, and some will be empty. Combatants will spawn outside with no weapons. The combatants score points by killing others. With no weapons, it's all hand to hand combat. Combatants can also enter houses to pillage for weapons. Some doors will be unlocked. Other's need to be broken down. Picks locked. Windows busted. Just get in there and find a weapon.

Here's where it gets interesting. EVERYTHING in the house can be used as a weapon. Phones. Books. Chairs. Keyboards. Guitars. Remotes. Art. TVs. Microwaves. Pencils. Screwdrivers. Cups. Computers. Brooms. Ethernet Cables. Ladders. Microwaves. Keys. Shaving Cream. Scissors. CDs. The Refrigerator. Everything. At Level 1 combatants can hold two items.

There are two ways to win an Arena match. Reach the score limit (determined by number of combatants, neighborhood, voting, or server), or login 10 times. Each kill scores the combatant one point. To login, a combatant must find a computer, login on fantasyfuture.org, and enter the match they were already playing. The original combatant will stay at the computer and the new virtual combatant will spawn in the neighborhood, also able to kill and earn points. To login again, the virtual combatant must find a different computer. If the original combatant gets killed, the virtual combatant will be frozen in the neighborhood until tagged by an original, logged in again, or killed. To win, the combatant must have 9 virtual players in the neighborhood at the same time. Once virtual combatant #9 logs in, they win.

Every time a combatant gets a kill, they earn happy points. Every happy point that is earned also earns the player money points. Money points can spent and stolen, but happy points cannot. To level up, a player must reach a certain number of happy points or spend a number of money points. (leveling up is purchaseable. spending money on weapons or tools or art will not get you closer to leveling up)

A good way to earn happy points is by accomplishing specials. Accomplishing specials will earn a player anywhere from an extra 1% to an extra 10000% Some specials will be normal and are listed for the player to see. (First blood. Killing spree. Game Win. Headshots. Doublekill. Kill an enemy with their own weapon.) A vast majority won't be listed until a player accomplishes them on accident. And they will be mostly absurd and ridiculous. (Shoot a player in the heart while "Shot Through the Heart" is playing. Drink alcohol before 5 PM on a Saturday. Knock someone out by chucking a shoe at their head. Bite someone's jugular on a full moon night. Teabag a player after disarming them and neutralizing them without using a weapon and not getting harmed. Travel a marathon. Disturb a dinner party. Slam someone's face on a barbecue grill. Lick a window inside a car. Put a snake in someone's boot. Crash a POS car. [As many music lyric and movie references as possible] Midnight knife kill. Get struck by lightning. Get struck by lightning twice in one day. Get struck by lighting on a clear day. Burn down someones house for playing a song you hate. Swallow every pill in someone's medicine cabinet. Save a hooker's life. Run someone over while driving in reverse. Strangle someone while naked. Cut someone in half with a chainsaw. Puff on an e-cig during a sunrise. Swing a golf ball into someone. Smack someone in the head with a Bible. Mushroom stamp.) Specials will either earn a player an extra percentage for the kill or a certain number of extra happy points, or both. In general, the more obtuse the weapon, the more happy points. Happy points have no affect on game score points. The more kills you have per game, the more each kill is worth in happy points. (Kill #2 worth 20 happy points. Kill #20 worth 200 happy points [not necessarily those numbers, or so perfectly linear, but that's the basic idea]

Level 2 unlocks sprinting (level 2 should be able to be unlocked after playing for 30 minutes)

Level 3 unlocks multies. Multies means you'll have unlimited of whatever weapon you pick up. (not unlimited ammo) If you pick up a knife, you'll be able to throw the knife again and again without needing to pick it up.

Level 4 unlocks parry

Level 5 unlocks spawn with weapons you died with

Level 6 unlocks aim assist

In Naughty Neighbors Arena, the idea is level playing field. Before entering a match, you choose to either play with people at the same level as you, or choose to play within a range of your current level.

Once you reach level 30, things get completely mixed up. certain things are no longer unlocked at each level up. the level keeps track of how much you've played and determines the happy points earned by killing others and the happy points earned by others when they kill you.

The Mixed Up Madness: before the match starts there will be a list of all the things enabled and disabled. Everyone in the match can do all the same things. It's just a matter of how *well* you can do the things available to you. To better understand what I mean when I say "things", read Naughty Neighbors Pro.

- **Naughty Neighbors Pro**

NNP will also have combatants spawning in a neighborhood with no weapons. The difference is that Pro will not be a level playing field. Advantages will be unlocked by leveling up, purchases, and finding items. Many advantages won't be accessible until the player reaches a certain level.
